# 2021-Philadelphia-Shooting-Victims-Database
For this project, I used PostgreSQL to build a database for storing data related to shooting victims in Philadelphia that occured in 2021. `incidents_part1.cvs` and `incidents_part2.csv` provided the main dataset.My goals for this project is as follows:
  - Create `victims.csv` for storing all 2021 shooting victims data
  - Ceate the database `victims_philly`with the table `shooting_victims`
  - Create `shooting_victims` with appropriate data types from `victims.csv`
  - Create `master` and `student` user groups with appropriate privleges
  - Create users `senior` and `junior` and assign to `master` and `junior` groups
  - Verify privligaes of User Groups
